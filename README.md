This is C++11 based library and HAL for STM32

It include:

1) Makefile to setup needed environment and build project.
2) Linker script to separate and simplified your code.
3) Vector table for Cortex-M3 for simplified create interrupt handers.
4) Startup code for Cortex-M3 cpu with initialization of data & bss sections.
5) Prototype of startup and run code.
6) RCC and GPIO structures and helpers to simplified operations with hardware.
