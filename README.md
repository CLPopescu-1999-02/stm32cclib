This is C++11 based library and HAL for STM32

It include:

1) Makefile to setup needed environment and build project.
2) Linker script to separate and simplified your code.
3) Vector table for Cortex-M3 for simplified create interrupt handers.
4) Startup code for Cortex-M3,4 cpu with initialization of data & bss sections.
5) Vector table for Cortex-M4 for simplified create interrupt handers.
6) Setup C++ static objects
7) Prototype of startup and run code for stm32 mcus.
8) RCC, GPIO, PWR, LCD, TIM, RTC, EXTI, ADC, DMA, Core structures and helpers to simplified operations with hardware.
9) stm32l152c-discovery hex lcd bsp to simplified operation with hardware modules
10) stm32l152c-disco, stm32f3disco examples proto
