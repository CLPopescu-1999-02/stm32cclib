This is C++11 based library and HAL for STM32

It include:

1) CMake build system for simplifier create, build and upload to target
2) Linker script to separate and simplified your code.
3) Vector table for Cortex-M3,4 for simplified create interrupt handers.
4) Startup code for Cortex-M3,4 cpu with initialization of data & bss sections.
5) Setup C++ static objects
6) Template library and types for stm32 mcus.
7) Prototype of startup and run code for stm32 mcus.
8) RCC, GPIO, PWR, LCD, TIM, RTC, EXTI, ADC, DMA, Core structures and helpers to simplified operations with hardware.
9) stm32l152c-discovery hex lcd bsp to simplified operation with hardware modules
10) stm32l152c-disco, stm32f3disco, stm32f4-black examples proto
